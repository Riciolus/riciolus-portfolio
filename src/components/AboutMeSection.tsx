      <p>
        I&apos;m a 20-year-old Full Stack Developer with a strong passion for
        building digital products. My expertise lies in the JavaScript ecosystem,
        allowing me to work confidently across both frontend and backend development.
      </p>

      <p>
        Over the past couple of years, I&apos;ve worked on various personal projects
        and taken on small freelance opportunities. These experiences have helped me
        grow into a well-rounded developer who can take ideas from concept to
        reality.
      </p>

      <p>
        While I don&apos;t have formal achievements yet, I&apos;m driven by the
        mindset of becoming the best at what I do. Every project is a chance to
        sharpen my skills and create something impactful.
      </p>

      <p>
        When I&apos;m not immersed in code, you&apos;ll probably find me out running
        or exploring 3D animation. Whether through software, movement, or art,
        I&apos;m always creating and pushing myself forward.
